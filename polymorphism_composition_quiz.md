# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

The word polymorphism means many forms. 

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

When we apply polymorphism to OO design we are giving our classes some flexibility. In the case of the desktop, more than one thing can connect to it and you don't always know which one(s) it will be. With polymosphism you can expect something to connect, but it can be different depending on what is needed situationally.


3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

We need to use abstract classes and interfaces. We can have classes (Such as the devices we're connecting to a desktop) all inherit from a shared superclass. Since we can inherit from only one class, but can implement as many interfaces as we need; we can use interfaces to have a class gain the type of the interface without a complicated and problematic inheritance chain.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

As many as we need it to.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

When you have many different types of engine (electric/hybrid/fossilfuel/bio oil) you can have a superclass of engine and interfaces for each type of engine, so that the engine a vehicle has depends on what has been installed in it.



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?



7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.



8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?



9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
